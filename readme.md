Summary:
This plant locator is designed to help users determine where plants are in the LemnaTec Phenotyper system. Therefore it requires .state files from the computer local to the warehouse containing the conveyor belts and plants.

Use:
To view the state files, click the button "Load Folder" and navigate to any folder that is parent to the state files.
Fair warning: The entire folder and all its subdirectories are traversed and checked for .state files, so don't just load "C:/" out of laziness as the program will then have to look through the entire hard drive.

To export the state files, click the button "Export All" and indicate where you want the Excel (.xls) file to be located and by what name.
